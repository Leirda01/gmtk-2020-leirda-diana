# Drifting Hope

You are now the little balloon that you recall from your childhood.
You drift in that ravaged park in your now long past city.

Your hope is to live a bit longer in this world, where each move is meaningless and out of your control.

As a balloon, you should avoid stray bullets to stay a bit longer between the opponents.
