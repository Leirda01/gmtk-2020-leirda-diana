# Drifting Hope

**NOTE : Before downloading please be aware that this game is not completely playable. \
It suffers from at least 1 frequently occuring game breaking bug.**

A city ravaged by war. A deserted park turned battleground. \
A loose balloon drifting aimlessly in the wind and dancing around an endless carnage. \
The tale of the last beacon of hope in a colorless world...

**Your goal is to keep the blue balloon intact as many turns as possible. \
You don't control it directly, however. \
Instead use the arrow keys to control the soldiers in order to keep them in attack range of each other (indicated by red squares) but away from the balloon.**
